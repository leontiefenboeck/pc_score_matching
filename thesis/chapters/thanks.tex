First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Robert Peharz for his guidance and support throughout the course of this research.

Thank you for the countless hours we have spent pondering about the challenges I have faced during my research.

I would also like to express my gratitude to all staff members of the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science for providing such a pleasant research environment.

Furthermore, many thanks to Rishub Nagpal, Ga{\"{e}}tan Cassiers, and Christian Toth for the stimulating discussions and for the diverse perspectives they provided.


To my friends and colleagues, thank you for all the thought-provoking dialogues and the wonderful moments we have shared.

I owe special thanks to my family, who have continuously supported me in every regard and have always given me the freedom to follow my passions.
