\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{cha:conclusions}

In this thesis we experimentally tested different methods to train Probabilistic Circuits (PCs), specifically
we wanted to examine how recent developments in training Energy or Score based Models, namely 
Sliced Score Matching would transfer to PCs. 

Concluding we can say, we did not recognize any obvious benefits to use Score Matching, wether it being Sliced 
or Exact, over the conventional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) using either Gradient Descent 
or Expectation Maximization. While the Score Matching results were not horrible and even quite reasonable, 
they always lagged a little behind, in fact in none of our 
experiments did Score Matching overall perform better than MLE. The Log-Likelihood on the validation set was 
a little worse, the samples didn't look as compelling and it also took much longer to train. 

We did notice one upside compared to MLE, namely as already discussed the samples for the Image Generation 
Experiment were noticeably less blurry and more clear, however a lot of the times this came with the downside,
that more or less only one different image could be generated, i.e. all samples looked quite similar.
